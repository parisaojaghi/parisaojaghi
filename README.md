- 👋 Hi, I’m Parisa
- 👀 I’m interested in leveraging data to solve complex problems, optimize processes, and drive business outcomes. My curiosity lies in uncovering patterns, insights, and trends from data to make informed decisions and predictions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced SQL, Python for data analysis (pandas, NumPy), and data visualization tools (Tableau, Power BI). I'm also diving into big data technologies such as Apache Spark and Hadoop to prepare for the challenges of data engineering.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focusing on data analytics and engineering, especially those that allow me to apply my analytical skills and product design background to improve data processing, analysis, and visualization practices.
